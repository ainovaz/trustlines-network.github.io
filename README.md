# Trustlines Network 

The Trustlines Network is the first open permissionless
platform for hosting currency networks
representing real-world obligations


In laymen's terms, the Trustlines Network is the original Ripple Pay on the Ethereum. Using IOUs on the social graph can be effectively used to create fungible money and facilitate payments between non-trusting participants on a global scale.

This is just a landing page that gives you a basic introduction to the application.
