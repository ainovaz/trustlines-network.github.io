            Asking this question, you properly already have access to a bank account, credit card and/or mobile payments.
            Complementing your regular financial channels with the Trustlines Network offers you:

            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>            Cheaper, secure and faster global transactions
                <li>            The easiest gateway to virtual complementary currencies
                <li>            The power to decide who you want to be liable to
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              In short, you would prefer to take control by retaining the benefits of acting as a bank.
              You would also like to decide yourself who you are comfortable being liable to you,
              and who you would like to be liable to.

            <p>Local currencies specific to a community, offers a way to keep money circulating and increases the economic activity within the realm of the community. This is contrary to pumping international homogeneous currencies into an area, which tends to flow straight back to the source, without making any sustainable economic community impact.</p>

            <p>At the same time, communities tends to have a demand for goods or services provided by outside suppliers, which means they also needs to be able to pay in currencies that they trust and accept.</p>

            <p>This dilemma requires communities uses more than one currency which is exactly what the Trustlines Network enables. According to the prioritisation made on effectiveness and resilience, communities are empowered to customise local networks while they can also participate in interconnected networks.</p>

            <p>The Trustlines Network can be viewed as an interconnected global network of LETSystems
            in which each subsystem is managed by a single individual.</p>

            <p>A classic LETSystem is centralised and only tracks obligations to and from central intermediaries
            in a mutual-credit fashion. In effect this means if someone defaults, the loss of credit is shared with everyone,
            thus arguably only making it suitable for small communities.</p>

            <p>With Trustlines, obligations are dedicated to specific individuals who agreed to trust you,
            holding you personal accountable. We believe personal trust relations based on individual reliability
            provides a stronger incentive for individuals to honor their obligations than in a mutual-credit based system.</p>

            <p>Next comes the benefit of automatic accounting, tamper-proof documentation as well as the option to enable
            currency network interoperability.</p>

            <p>Trustlines is in its core inspired by the classic.ripplepay idea invented by Ryan Fugger,
            Ryan is no longer involved in Ripple, and the company has chosen to change the original peer-to-peer model
            into what they have named an institution-to-institution model.</p>

            <p>In a similar way, the Stellar foundation have also implemented gateways (called "anchors") which are central hub
            like entities, that need to be trusted and issue credit on the network based on deposits.</p>

            <p>In the Trustlines Network there is not implemented any centralised gateway model.
            Instead related to how Abra 'tellers', are acting like 'human ATMs',
            the Trustlines Network take this idea one step further and enables every user to act like a bank.</p>

            <p>This is the case, because every Trustlines user issues credit in virtual currencies to the people they trust,
            in the same manner as commercial banks creates legal tender fiat money today.</p>

            <p>While the unbanked are increasingly getting smartphones,
            they still cannot get financial services because both mobile applications and traditional banks
            require government ID/cash deposits or credit cards to work.
            The Trustlines Network enables the unbanked access to payments without the needing any of that
            this is made possible by credit issuance through the social graph of every user.</p>

            <p>The Trustlines Network provides the unbanked the means for payment, exchange, savings,
            loaning as well as access to future financial empowering tools.
            Interpersonal relations often governs credit issuance in many unbanked societies and the Trustlines Network
            is based on the same simple and proven mechanisms found in for example, the Hawala system.</p>

            <p>The big difference to these current informal offerings is the automatic accounting system,
            predefined mutual-agreed conditions, as well as the tamper-proof documentation of who owes what to whom.</p>
