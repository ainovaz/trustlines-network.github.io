                The Trustlines Network is built as a decentralized platform hosting customized and interconnected
                IOU based currency networks. Contrary to present centralized collaborative finance platforms,
                this enables secure, transparent and permissionless P2P transactions. The platform comes as an
                open protocol and API supporting interoperability with other smart contract based services on the
                Ethereum platform. Developers worldwide can therefore build collaborative finance applications
                on top of the platform.
